# AML-project

DeepProbLog is an extension of ProbLog that integrates Probabilistic Logic Programming with deep learning by means of neural predicates.

The aim of this project is to show how to solve AI tasks that require the integration of high-level reasoning and low-level perception. We focus on the multi-digit MNIST octal-division task that consists in computing the division between two lists of MNIST digits representing multi-digit octal numbers. Using DeepProbLog we are able to solve the task given that supervision is only present at the output side of the probabilistic reasoner and considering that the approach can be extended to multi-digit numbers without being explicitly trained on them.
